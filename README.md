# three-todos
Three To-Do's A Day is my version of a to-do list created with JavaScript - fewer meaningless tasks and more mindful items to make progresson larger goals.

Having three primary things to strive for each day in pursuit of a bigger goal is much more helpful and effective than having a never-ending to-do list day after day.

Be mindful. Choose only three main priorities today.

Latest features:
- List items render from input form below the input form
- App only allows for three list items (more than three items will not be accepted)
- Option to clear all items from current rendered list
- Empty state that prompts user to enter item into form (only present if no list items are rendered)

Next up for this project:
- Adding options to remove item and complete item to each list item
- Adding more interactive svg's as buttons
