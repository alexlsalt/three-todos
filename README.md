# three-todos
Three To-Do's A Day is my version of a to-do list created with JavaScript - fewer meaningless tasks and more mindful items to make progresson larger goals.

Having three primary things to strive for each day in pursuit of a bigger goal is much more helpful and effective than having a never-ending to-do list day after day.

Be mindful. Choose only three main priorities today.

Next up for this project:
- Adding options to remove item and complete item to each list item
- Adding more interactive svg's as buttons
